     <p>Acid, which started as Precious Page, is a notable speed metal band from Bruges, Belgium, founded in 1980. The band was one of the first bands in the New Wave of British Heavy Metal on the European mainland and their records have become collector's items in the metal genre.</p>

      <p>According to AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia, the band initially devoted themselves to Heavy metal, before moving on to Thrash metal shortly after, during which they were influenced by Venom and Raven. Rivadavia labeled the debut album as Speed Metal and Satanic. According to Martin Popoff in his book The Collector's Guide of Heavy Metal Volume 2: The Eighties, Acid's double bass is reminiscent of Motörhead. According to thethrashmetalguide.com, the band was a pioneer of speed and thrash metal, as they were the first band alongside Anvil to show the aggressive side of this scene. Besides Girlschool(UK) it was also one of the first bands in the scene with a female singer.</p>
